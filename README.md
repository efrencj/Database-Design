# Database-Design
# Introduction

This repository contains my work from the **Database Design** course, which builds upon the foundations learned in **Introduction to Databases**. In this subject, I am diving deeper into the principles of **database modeling, normalization, and optimization** to create more efficient and scalable databases.

## Learning Experience

As I progress through this course, I am working extensively with **advanced SQL (Oracle)** and improving my skills in **database normalization and optimization techniques**. I am also learning to design more complex relational models using tools like **Oracle Data Modeler**.

This subject presents new challenges, requiring a more detailed and structured approach to database architecture. However, it is also helping me develop a deeper understanding of how to design databases that are both **efficient and well-structured**.

## Ongoing Journey

Since I am still taking this course, I continue to refine my knowledge and improve my database design skills. Each project and assignment brings new insights, helping me become more proficient in **data management and relational database structuring**.

## Conclusion

This repository reflects my current learning process in **Database Design**. As I advance in the subject, I look forward to further improving my database modeling skills and applying them to real-world applications.
